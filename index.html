<h1>Training Wheels</h1>
<h2>Welcome to Training Wheels.</h2>
<p>
  If you are a student and are looking for your environment,<br />
  please ensure you're using the exact web address that has been<br />
  provided by an instructor. It should be something like:<br />
  <br />
  http://name.course.training.com/
</p>
<p>
  If you are an instructor and are looking for the controller<br />
  interface, please check you have the correct address and port<br />
  number. The controller will normally be on port 8000, so: <br />
  <br />
  http://training.com:8000/
